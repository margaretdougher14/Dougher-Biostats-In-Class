## Set things up

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Input Data

```{r}
drugs <- read.csv(here("Data", "drug_resistance.csv"))
glimpse(drugs)
```

## Now make Treatment into a factor variable

```{r}
drugs$Treatment <- as.factor (drugs$Treatment)
```

## Now fix the treatment variable

## Find the rows that have any version of "control"

## Use which() function to do so

```{r}
fix <- which(drugs$Treatment %in% c("cantrol", "control", "Control")) #identify the rows that need repair

drugs$Treatment[fix] <- "control"
levels(drugs$Treatment)
drugs$Treatment <- factor(drugs$Treatment) #this just tells R to re-list the levels of my factor now that they have changed
levels(drugs$Treatment)
```

```{r}
fix2 <- which(drugs$Treatment %in% c("drug x 2", "drug2", "Drugx2")) #identify the rows that need repair

drugs$Treatment[fix2] <- "drug2"
levels(drugs$Treatment)
drugs$Treatment <- factor(drugs$Treatment)
levels(drugs$Treatment)
```
